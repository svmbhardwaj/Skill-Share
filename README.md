# ‚ú® SkillShare Local ‚ú®

### *Your Neighborhood's Skill Marketplace*

[](https://nextjs.org/) [](https://nodejs.org/) [](https://www.mongodb.com/) [](https://stripe.com/)

In busy cities like Delhi, it's hard to find trusted help for small jobs, while many talented locals lack a simple way to offer their skills. **SkillShare Local** is a hyperlocal platform that fixes this. We connect neighbors to share skills and services, all backed by a secure, cashless payment system to build a stronger, more self-reliant community.

## Key Features

  * **Hyperlocal Search:** Instantly finds skilled providers within your immediate area using geospatial queries.
  * **End-to-End Booking:** Full job lifecycle from hiring a provider to a provider accepting on their dashboard.
  * **Secure Cashless Payments:** Integrated Stripe payments for safe and reliable transactions.
  * **Unified "My Jobs" Dashboard:** A single place for users to manage tasks as both a client and a provider.
  * **Dynamic UI:** A modern, responsive interface that intelligently displays options based on login status.

-----

## Tech Stack

  * **Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB with Mongoose, JWT for authentication.
  * **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, CSS Modules.
  * **Payments:** Stripe API with Webhooks for reliable payment confirmation.

-----

## üîß Challenges & Solutions

  * **Challenge:** Building a fast, location-based search.

      * **Solution:** We used MongoDB's native `2dsphere` geospatial indexing, allowing for highly efficient queries to find providers in a given radius.

  * **Challenge:** Guaranteeing payment confirmation is secure and reliable.

      * **Solution:** We built our system around **Stripe Webhooks**. The backend listens for the `payment_intent.succeeded` event directly from Stripe's servers, ensuring the database is updated only after payment is 100% confirmed.

  * **Challenge:** Creating a dashboard that works for two different user roles (client and provider).

      * **Solution:** The frontend decodes the user's JWT to get their ID and uses **conditional rendering** to show the correct actions (e.g., "Accept Job" for a provider, "Pay Now" for a client).

## ‚ú® Future Scope

  * In-app chat between users.
  * A provider review and rating system.
  * Admin-driven provider verification badges.
  * Push notifications for job status updates.
